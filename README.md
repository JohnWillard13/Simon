## How to Play
___


### In the game of Simon, you will click the Start button to play. Watch the colors on the right as they are displayed in a random pattern. Once the pattern is done and the games says "Your Turn", click the colors to repeat the pattern. If you get it right, you will move on to the next round and it will display the same pattern plus a new color.

### If you get it wrong, you will lose and have to click Start again and will have a brand new random pattern.

### If you click the colors WHILE the computer is showing you the random pattern, you will be hit with a loss and it will say that you must wait for the computer to finish displaying the pattern as this is considered cheating in the game.
